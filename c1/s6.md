WHEN COMPUTERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED, ordinary people -- including most programmers -- couldn't get near them. They were locked up in rooms with white-coated attendants who would take your programs and data, feed them to the computer, and return the computer's response some time later. When timesharing -- where the computer switches its attention rapidly from one person to another -- was invented in the 1960s, it became possible for several people to interact directly with the computer at the same time. On a timesharing system, users sit at "terminals" where they type commands to the computer, and the computer types back its response. Early personal computers also used typed commands and responses, except that there was only one person involved at a time. This type of interaction between a user and a computer is called a **command-line interface**.

计算机刚问世时，普通人——包括大多数程序员——都不允许靠近计算机。计算机被锁在有值班员看守的房间里，这些人穿着白色工作服，负责把你的程序和数据输入电脑里，一段时间后就会返回计算机的运行结果。20世纪60年代发明了分时系统——计算机能够快速地把运行的工作从一个用户切换到另外一个用户的系统，这使多个用户同时直接与计算机交互成为可能。在分时系统里，多个用户坐在“终端”旁输入命令到计算机里，计算机就会打印出它的响应信息。之前的个人计算机同样使用输入命令和打印出响应的方式，不同之处是只能同时存在一个用户。用户与电脑的这种交互方式叫作**命令行界面操作**。

Today, of course, most people interact with computers in a completely different way. They use a **Graphical User Interface**, or GUI. The computer draws interface **components** on the screen. The components include things like windows, scroll bars, menus, buttons, and icons. Usually, a **mouse** is used to manipulate such components or, on "touchscreens," your fingers. Assuming that you have not just been teleported in from the 1970s, you are no doubt already familiar with the basics of graphical user interfaces!

当然，现在的大多数人都在使用完全不同的方式与计算机进行交互。他们使用**图形用户界面**，简称GUI。计算机在屏幕上绘制界面**组件**。这些组件包括窗口、滚动条、菜单、按钮和图标等。通常来说，我们使用**鼠标**来操作这些组件，或者在触控屏上用手指来操作。只要你不是刚从二十世纪七十年代穿越而来的，你肯定已经很熟悉图形用户界面的基础了。

A lot of GUI interface components have become fairly standard. That is, they have similar appearance and behavior on many different computer platforms including Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. Java programs, which are supposed to run on many different platforms without modification to the program, can use all the standard GUI components. They might vary a little in appearance from platform to platform, but their functionality should be identical on any computer on which the program runs.

大部分的GUI交互组件都已经相当标准化了。也就是说，它们拥有相似的外观并且能在包括Mac OS、Windows和Linux这些不同的计算机平台上运行。Java能够使用所有的这些GUI组件，而且它的目标是让这些组件在不用修改程序的前提下能够在不同的平台上运行。这些组件的外观在不同的平台上可能会有点不同，但是程序在任意计算机上提供的功能应该是一样的。

Shown below is an image of a very simple Java program that demonstrates a few standard GUI interface components. When the program is run, a window similar to the picture shown here will open on the computer screen. There are four components in the window with which the user can interact: a button, a checkbox, a text field, and a pop-up menu. These components are labeled. There are a few other components in the window. The labels themselves are components (even though you can't interact with them). The right half of the window is a text area component, which can display multiple lines of text. A scrollbar component appears alongside the text area when the number of lines of text becomes larger than will fit in the text area. And in fact, in Java terminology, the whole window is itself considered to be a "component."

下面的图片中，一个简单的Java程序演示了一些GUI界面组件。当程序运行时，计算机屏幕上就会显示出一个与下图类似的窗体。在这个窗体里有四个可以和用户交互的组件：按钮、复选框、文本域和弹出菜单。这些组件都被标签标明了。这个窗体里还有一些其他的组件。标签本身就是一个组件（即使你不能与它进行交互）。窗体的右半部是一个文本域组件，它可以显示多行文本。当文本的行数大于刚好填充满文本域的行数时，滚动条组件就会出现在文本域的一边。实际上，在Java中，这整个窗体本身就被认为是一个“组件”。

(If you would like to run this program, the source code, [*GUIDemo.java*][1], as well as a compiled program, [*GUIDemo.jar*][2], are available on line. For more information on using this and other examples from this textbook, see [Section 2.6][3].)

（如果你想要运行这个程序，你可以在网上获取[*GUIDemo.java*][1]源码和已编译的程序[*GUIDemo.jar*][2]，这本书更多其他示例及使用说明可以参考[2.6节][3]。）

Now, Java actually has two complete sets of GUI components. One of these, the AWT or **Abstract Windowing Toolkit**, was available in the original version of Java. The other, which is known as **Swing**, was introduced in Java version 1.2, and is used in preference to the AWT in most modern Java programs. The program that is shown above uses components that are part of Swing.

如今，Java实际上拥有两个完整的GUI组件集合。其中一个是AWT或者叫**抽象窗体工具集**（Abstract Windowing Toolkit），Java的原始版本就提供了这个工具集。另外一个叫作**Swing**，它是在Java 1.2时发布的。并且在大多数的现代Java编程中都优先使用Swing。上面演示的程序就使用了Swing的部分组件。

When a user interacts with GUI components, "events" are generated. For example, clicking a push button generates an event, and pressing return while typing in a text field generates an event. Each time an event is generated, a message is sent to the program telling it that the event has occurred, and the program responds according to its program. In fact, a typical GUI program consists largely of "event handlers" that tell the program how to respond to various types of events. In this example, the program has been programmed to respond to each event by displaying a message in the text area. In a more realistic example, the event handlers would have more to do.

当用户使用GUI组件进行交互时，“事件”的概念就产生了。例如，点击一下按钮就会产生一个事件，在文本域打字时按回车会产生事件。每次产生事件都会向程序发生一条消息，告诉它发送了什么事件，然后程序就根据它的编码去响应事件。事实上，一个典型的GUI程序由大量的“事件处理器”组成，它们负责告诉程序如何去响应各种类型的事件。在这个例子中，该程序被编程为通过在文本域里打印信息来响应每一个事件。在更实际的例子中，事件处理器可以做更多的事。

The use of the term "message" here is deliberate. Messages, as you saw in the [previous section][4], are sent to objects. In fact, Java GUI components are implemented as objects. Java includes many predefined classes that represent various types of GUI components. Some of these classes are subclasses of others. Here is a diagram showing just a few of Swing's GUI classes and their relationships:

这里使用“消息（message）”术语是有意图的。就像你在[上一节][4]里所看到的，消息会被发送给对象。实际上，Java GUI组件都是一些对象。Java包括了很多预定义类，这些类代表了各种类型的GUI组件。其中的一些类又是其他类的子类。这里有一张图仅展示了一些Swing的GUI类和它们的关系：

Don't worry about the details for now, but try to get some feel about how object-oriented programming and inheritance are used here. Note that all the GUI classes are subclasses, directly or indirectly, of a class called JComponent, which represents general properties that are shared by all Swing components. In the diagram, two of the direct subclasses of JComponent themselves have subclasses. The classes JTextArea and JTextField, which have certain behaviors in common, are grouped together as subclasses of JTextComponent. Similarly JButton and JToggleButton are subclasses of JAbstractButton, which represents properties common to both buttons and checkboxes. (JComboBox, by the way, is the Swing class that represents pop-up menus.)

现在不用担心它们的细节，但要去感受下在这里是如何使用面向对象编程和继承的。注意，所有的GUI类都直接或者间接地属于*JComponent*类的子类，这个类包含了所有Swing组件共享的常规属性。在上图中，有两个*JComponent*的直接子类本身就拥有自己的子类。*JTextArea*和*JTextField*类都拥有一些相同的行为，并一起被分组到*JTextComponent*的子类下。类似地，*JButton*和*JToggleButton*都是*JAbstractButton*的子类，它们都包含了按钮和复选框这些共有的属性。（顺便说一下，*JComboBox*是一个包含弹出菜单的Swing类。）

Just from this brief discussion, perhaps you can see how GUI programming can make effective use of object-oriented design. In fact, GUIs, with their "visible objects," are probably a major factor contributing to the popularity of OOP.

仅从这个简单的论述中，你或许可以看到GUI编程是怎样有效地利用面向对象设计的。实际上，拥有“可视化对象”的GUI可能是推进OOP流行的主要因素。

Programming with GUI components and events is one of the most interesting aspects of Java. However, we will spend several chapters on the basics before returning to this topic in [Chapter 6][5].

使用GUI组件和事件编程是Java最有趣的一个方面。但是，我们会先使用几个章节来介绍基础知识，并在[第6章][5]重返这个话题。
