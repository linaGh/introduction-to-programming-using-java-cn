WHEN YOU BEGIN a journey, it's a good idea to have a mental map of the terrain you'll be passing through. The same is true for an intellectual journey, such as learning to write computer programs. In this case, you'll need to know the basics of what computers are and how they work. You'll want to have some idea of what a computer program is and how one is created. Since you will be writing programs in the Java programming language, you'll want to know something about that language in particular and about the modern computing environment for which Java is designed.

**当你要开始一段旅途的时候**，最好提前了解一下要经过的路线。编程之路亦如此。因此，你就得知道计算机到底是什么，它们是如何工作的。你会想知道程序是什么，如何创建一个程序。既然你将用 Java 编程，那么你一定想知道一些这门语言的特点，还有Java诞生的背景。

As you read this chapter, don't worry if you can't understand everything in detail. (In fact, it would be impossible for you to learn all the details from the brief expositions in this chapter.) Concentrate on learning enough about the big ideas to orient yourself, in preparation for the rest of the book. Most of what is covered in this chapter will be covered in much greater detail later in the book.

当你读这段话的时候，用不着担心自己不知道这些东西的全部细节（在这个简短的概述中就知道所有内容也是不可能的。）在本章中，争取有一个总体的概念，以为本书后面的内容做准备。本章中提到的大部分内容将会在后面详细介绍。
