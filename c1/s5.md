PROGRAMS MUST BE DESIGNED. No one can just sit down at the computer and compose a program of any complexity. The discipline called **software engineering** is concerned with the construction of correct, working, well-written programs. The software engineer tries to use accepted and proven methods for analyzing the problem to be solved and for designing a program to solve that problem.

所有的程序都需要经过严谨的设计。没有人可以坐在电脑前凭空将一些复杂的逻辑写成程序。**软件工程**这门学科就是研究程序结构的正确性，能否正常工作以及书写规范的。软件工程师的工作就是使用已被证明正确的方法去分析问题，然后设计一个程序来解决这个问题。

During the 1970s and into the 80s, the primary software engineering methodology was **structured programming**. The structured programming approach to program design was based on the following advice: To solve a large problem, break the problem into several pieces and work on each piece separately; to solve each piece, treat it as a new problem which can itself be broken down into smaller problems; eventually, you will work your way down to problems that can be solved directly, without further decomposition. This approach is called **top-down programming**.

在19世纪70至80年代间，**结构化编程**是主要的程序设计方法。结构化编程的大体思路是：将待解决的问题分解成几个小问题，然后再对小问题进行分解，直到问题可以直接解决为止。这就是**自上而下的编程方法**。

There is nothing wrong with top-down programming. It is a valuable and often-used approach to problem-solving. However, it is incomplete. For one thing, it deals almost entirely with producing the **instructions** necessary to solve a problem. But as time went on, people realized that the design of the **data structures** for a program was at least as important as the design of subroutines and control structures. Top-down programming doesn't give adequate consideration to the data that the program manipulates.

自上而下的程序设计方法很常用，具备一定价值，但却有待完善。比如，用这种方法编程基本上只写解决某一问题的必要**指令**。不久人们就发现，**数据结构**和子程序设计及流程控制同样重要。自上而下程序设计并没有充分考虑对数据的操作。

Another problem with strict top-down programming is that it makes it difficult to reuse work done for other projects. By starting with a particular problem and subdividing it into convenient pieces, top-down programming tends to produce a design that is unique to that problem. It is unlikely that you will be able to take a large chunk of programming from another program and fit it into your project, at least not without extensive modification. Producing high-quality programs is difficult and expensive, so programmers and the people who employ them are always eager to reuse past work.

这种方法的另一个弊端就是代码难以复用。从分解问题的方法出发，自上而下编程倾向于针对特定问题来设计。这样，你就很难在别的大型工程中复用这些代码，即使勉强可以使用， 也要进行大量修改。写高质量的程序代码费时费力，所以程序员和工程师都尽可能的复用以前的工作。

So, in practice, top-down design is often combined with **bottom-up design**. In bottom-up design, the approach is to start "at the bottom," with problems that you already know how to solve (and for which you might already have a reusable software component at hand). From there, you can work upwards towards a solution to the overall problem.

所以，在实际的程序开发中，自上而下的程序设计通常与**自下而上的设计**相结合。在自下而上的设计方法中，如果你对某个问题已经有了已知的解决方法，或者手头有可复用的工作，就可以从这里开始，逐步向上工作，来解决整个问题。

The reusable components should be as "modular" as possible. A **module** is a component of a larger system that interacts with the rest of the system in a simple, well-defined, straightforward manner. The idea is that a module can be "plugged into" a system. The details of what goes on inside the module are not important to the system as a whole, as long as the module fulfills its assigned role correctly. This is called **information hiding**, and it is one of the most important principles of software engineering.

复用部分的组件应该尽可能的模块化。一个**模块**能够和系统的其他部分进行交互，并遵循简洁，规范的设计原则。就像是模块通过「插头」插入系统，模块内部是如何运作的，对系统来说并不重要，只要这个模块的功能运作良好就行了。这就是**信息隐藏**，在软件工程中是一中重要的思想。

One common format for software modules is to contain some data, along with some subroutines for manipulating that data. For example, a mailing-list module might contain a list of names and addresses along with a subroutine for adding a new name, a subroutine for printing mailing labels, and so forth. In such modules, the data itself is often hidden inside the module; a program that uses the module can then manipulate the data only indirectly, by calling the subroutines provided by the module. This protects the data, since it can only be manipulated in known, well-defined ways. And it makes it easier for programs to use the module, since they don't have to worry about the details of how the data is represented. Information about the representation of the data is hidden.

软件模块都要包含一些数据，以及这些数据的处理方法。例如，一个邮件列表模块就得包含一些名字、地址的信息，和这些信息的处理方法，像是添加新名字，显示地址之类的方法等等。在这样的模块中，数据对模块外是不可见的，以保证只有模块中的方法可以以正确的方式处理这些数据。这也使得对模块编程的时候更加方便，只要调用这些方法就可以了，并不需要知道实现的细节。

Modules that could support this kind of information-hiding became common in programming languages in the early 1980s. Since then, a more advanced form of the same idea has more or less taken over software engineering. This latest approach is called **object-oriented programming**, often abbreviated as OOP.

支持模块的信息隐藏的编程语言从80年代开始流行。那时候起，一种类似的更加先进的编程方法统治了软件开发行业——**面向对象编程**（object-priented programming，缩写 OOP）。

The central concept of object-oriented programming is the **object**, which is a kind of module containing data and subroutines. The point-of-view in OOP is that an object is a kind of self-sufficient entity that has an internal state (the data it contains) and that can respond to **messages** (calls to its subroutines). A mailing list object, for example, has a state consisting of a list of names and addresses. If you send it a message telling it to add a name, it will respond by modifying its state to reflect the change. If you send it a message telling it to print itself, it will respond by printing out its list of names and addresses.

面向对象编程概念的核心是对象，**对象**就是内含数据和数据的处理方法的模块。在面向对象的概念中，对象是一个自我实现的实体，有一个内部状态（就是存储的数据），能够对外界的**信息**作出回应（调用内部的方法）。用邮件列表对象举例，它内部有个包含了名字、地址信息的状态，如果你向它发送信息，要添加一个名字，他就会通过修改自身的状态来回应你。如果你发送打印自己的信息，它就会打印内部保存的名字和地址。

The OOP approach to software engineering is to start by identifying the objects involved in a problem and the messages that those objects should respond to. The program that results is a collection of objects, each with its own data and its own set of responsibilities. The objects interact by sending messages to each other. There is not much "top-down" in the large-scale design of such a program, and people used to more traditional programs can have a hard time getting used to OOP. However, people who use OOP would claim that object-oriented programs tend to be better models of the way the world itself works, and that they are therefore easier to write, easier to understand, and more likely to be correct.

面向对象的程序设计就是通过修改一个对象开始，使它能对传入的信息作出正确回应来解决问题。编程的最终工作结果是一个对象集合，每一个都存有一些数据及方法，对象之间通过传送信息来交互。这种编程的大规模设计上自上而下的思想并不是很多。习惯了传统编程方法的人对这种面向对象编程会不适应。但是，使用面向对象编程的人完全可以这样宣称：这种编程方法更加符合自然规律——事物自己工作。更不用说这种编程方法更易写、易懂、正确率高。

You should think of objects as "knowing" how to respond to certain messages. Different objects might respond to the same message in different ways. For example, a "print" message would produce very different results, depending on the object it is sent to. This property of objects -- that different objects can respond to the same message in different ways -- is called **polymorphism**.

你可以这样想：对象就是知道对于不同的信息做出怎样的回应。对相同的信息来说，不同的对象可能做出不同的回应。例如，不同的对象对于「打印」信息做出的回应可能截然不同。不同的对象对相同的信息做出不同的回应，这种特性就叫做**多态**。

It is common for objects to bear a kind of "family resemblance" to one another. Objects that contain the same type of data and that respond to the same messages in the same way belong to the same **class**. (In actual programming, the class is primary; that is, a class is created and then one or more objects are created using that class as a template.) But objects can be similar without being in exactly the same class.

一个对象可以和其他对象相似。存储的信息类型相同，对于相同的信息能做出相同的回应的对象属于同一个**类**。（在实际的编程工作中，类的概念是主要的。这是因为，我们首先创建了类，然后在以这个类为模板创建了对象。）但是不属于同一个类的对象可以相似。

For example, consider a drawing program that lets the user draw lines, rectangles, ovals, polygons, and curves on the screen. In the program, each visible object on the screen could be represented by a software object in the program. There would be five classes of objects in the program, one for each type of visible object that can be drawn. All the lines would belong to one class, all the rectangles to another class, and so on. These classes are obviously related; all of them represent "drawable objects." They would, for example, all presumably be able to respond to a "draw yourself" message. Another level of grouping, based on the data needed to represent each type of object, is less obvious, but would be very useful in a program: We can group polygons and curves together as "multipoint objects," while lines, rectangles, and ovals are "two-point objects." (A line is determined by its two endpoints, a rectangle by two of its corners, and an oval by two corners of the rectangle that contains it. The rectangles that I am talking about here have sides that are vertical and horizontal, so that they can be specified by just two points; this is the common meaning of "rectangle" in drawing programs.) We could diagram these relationships as follows:

例如，假设有一个程序可以让用户在评不上画直线、三角、椭圆、多边形和曲线。在这个程序中，每一个可视的物体都有一个对应的对象。那么在这个程序中就会存在5个类，用以产生5个不同的可视对象。所有的直线对象属于同一个类，三角形属于另一个类，以此类推。显然，所有的这些类都是相关的，都代表了可绘制对象，都会对「绘制图形」的信息做出回应。另一种分组方式，建立在他们保存的数据所代表的图形上，这些关系不很明显，但是在编程中很有用：可以将多边形和曲线作为「多点对象」一组，直线、矩形、椭圆作为“两点对象”一组。（这是因为，直线通过两个点可以确定，矩形通过两对点可以确定，椭圆通过两个焦点可以确定。这里所说的矩形指的是所有边都垂直或者水平的矩形，编程中用到的矩形大多都是这样的。）我们可以用下面这个图标来表示他们的关系。

![A sample class hierarchy.](https://github.com/tangyouhua/introduction-to-programming-using-java-cn/blob/master/image/c1-s5-001.jpg)

DrawableObject, MultipointObject, and TwoPointObject would be classes in the program. MultipointObject and TwoPointObject would be **subclasses** of DrawableObject. The class Line would be a subclass of TwoPointObject and (indirectly) of DrawableObject. A subclass of a class is said to **inherit** the properties of that class. The subclass can add to its inheritance and it can even "override" part of that inheritance (by defining a different response to some method). Nevertheless, lines, rectangles, and so on **are** drawable objects, and the class DrawableObject expresses this relationship.

DrawableObject、MultipointObject、TwoPointObject 在程序中属于不同的类。MultipointObject 和 TwoPointObject 属于 DrawableObject 的**子类**。Line 属于 TwoPointObject 和 DrawableObject（非直接）的子类。子类**继承**了父类的特性，子类也可以写入新的特性来覆盖掉原来父类的特性（通过定义一个对信息的不同回应方式）。不过，Line Rectangle 这些对象**都是**可绘制对象，DrawableObject 对象表达了这一关系。

Inheritance is a powerful means for organizing a program. It is also related to the problem of reusing software components. A class is the ultimate reusable component. Not only can it be reused directly if it fits exactly into a program you are trying to write, but if it just almost fits, you can still reuse it by defining a subclass and making only the small changes necessary to adapt it exactly to your needs.

继承在程序设计中大有用处，因为这涉及到代码复用。而类就是代码复用的最终形式。如果已经有一个类满足你的需求，就可以直接来使用这个类。如果有和你的需求类似的类，你就可以通过定义一个子类，稍作修改来使用。

So, OOP is meant to be both a superior program-development tool and a partial solution to the software reuse problem. Objects, classes, and object-oriented programming will be important themes throughout the rest of this text. You will start using objects that are built into the Java language in the next chapter, and in Chapter 5 you will begin creating your own classes and objects.

综上，面向对象不仅是一种先进的编程方式，还是复用代码的一种手段。在接下来的章节中，对象、类和面向对象编程将会成为重要主题。[下一章][1]你将会开始在 Java 语言中使用对象。在[第5章][2]中你将会创建自己的类和对象。
