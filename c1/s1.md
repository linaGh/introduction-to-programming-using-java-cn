A COMPUTER IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM consisting of many different components. But at the heart -- or the brain, if you want -- of the computer is a single component that does the actual computing. This is the **Central Processing Unit**, or CPU. In a modern desktop computer, the CPU is a single "chip" on the order of one square inch in size. The job of the CPU is to execute programs.

**计算机是一个由不同组件构成的复杂系统**。但其心脏，或称为大脑，是进行实际计算的组件，我们称其为**中央处理器**（Central Processing Unit，CPU）。在现代的台式计算机中，CPU是一块约一平方英寸大小的芯片，它的工作是执行程序。

A program is simply a list of unambiguous instructions meant to be followed mechanically by a computer. A computer is built to carry out instructions that are written in a very simple type of language called **machine language**. Each type of computer has its own machine language, and the computer can directly execute a program only if the program is expressed in that language. (It can execute programs written in other languages if they are first translated into machine language.)

一个程序仅仅是一些无歧义的、由计算机机械地执行的指令。计算机能够执行那些由一种叫**机器语言**（Machine Language）所编写的指令，并且每种类型的计算机都有其自己的机器语言。因此，只要你的程序由相应的机器语言来表达，计算机便能直接执行它。（如果用其他种类的编程语言编写程序，并将其转换成相应的机器语言，你的程序同样可以执行。）

When the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer's **main memory** (also called the RAM or random access memory). In addition to the program, memory can also hold data that is being used or processed by the program. Main memory consists of a sequence of locations. These locations are numbered, and the sequence number of a **location** is called its **address**. An address provides a way of picking out one particular piece of information from among the millions stored in memory. When the CPU needs to access the program instruction or data in a particular location, it sends the address of that information as a signal to the memory; the memory responds by sending back the data contained in the specified location. The CPU can also store information in memory by specifying the information to be stored and the address of the location where it is to be stored.

当CPU执行一个程序的时候，这个程序存储于**主存**（Main Memory，也可称为Random Access Memory，RAM）之中。除了程序本身，主存中也存有该程序使用或处理的数据。主存由一系列按顺序编号的**存储单元**（Location）构成，这些单元的编号即为它们各自的主存**地址**。主存地址提供了一种从存储于主存中的数以百万计的信息中选出特定信息的方法。当CPU需要从特定的存储单元访问程序的指令或者数据，它就会让单元的地址通过一个信号发送给主存。接着，主存会将指定单元所包含的信息返回给CPU。同样，CPU也能通过指定需要存储到主存的信息以及存储它的单元地址，将信息存入主存中。

On the level of machine language, the operation of the CPU is fairly straightforward (although it is very complicated in detail). The CPU executes a program that is stored as a sequence of machine language instructions in main memory. It does this by repeatedly reading, or **fetching**, an instruction from memory and then carrying out, or executing, that instruction. This process -- fetch an instruction, execute it, fetch another instruction, execute it, and so on forever -- is called the **fetch-and-execute cycle**. With one exception, which will be covered in the [next section][1], this is all that the CPU ever does.

从机器语言层面看来，CPU的操作是相当简单的（尽管其中的细节相当的复杂）。当执行一个以一系列机器语言指令的形式存储于主存之中的程序时，CPU总是在重复地从主存中**提取**（Fetch）一条指令，然后执行（Execute）它。这个过程——读取一个指令然后执行它，再读取另一条并执行，如此往复——称作**读取-执行周期**（fetch-and-execute cycle）。这便是CPU全部的工作，不过也有一个例外情况，我将在[下一节][1]说明。

The details of the fetch-and-execute cycle are not terribly important, but there are a few basic things you should know. The CPU contains a few internal **registers**, which are small memory units capable of holding a single number or machine language instruction. The CPU uses one of these registers -- the **program counter**, or PC -- to keep track of where it is in the program it is executing. The PC simply stores the memory address of the next instruction that the CPU should execute. At the beginning of each fetch-and-execute cycle, the CPU checks the PC to see which instruction it should fetch. During the course of the fetch-and-execute cycle, the number in the PC is updated to indicate the instruction that is to be executed in the next cycle. (Usually, but not always, this is just the instruction that sequentially follows the current instruction in the program.)

对你来说，了解读取-执行周期的细节并不是非常重要，但是有一些基础知识你需要知晓：CPU包含几个内置**寄存器**，每个寄存器是一个能够保存一个数字或者一条机器指令的小型的内存单元。CPU用其中一个称为**程序计数器**（Program Counter，PC)的寄存器来保持对正在执行的程序指令执行位置的跟踪。PC仅保存CPU将要执行的下一条指令的主存地址。在每一个读取-执行周期开始前，CPU将确保PC知道CPU将要提取哪一条指令。在周期的过程当中，PC中的数值将更新为下一个循环中CPU所需执行的指令的主存地址。（下一循环的指令往往就是同一程序中紧挨当前指令的下一条。）

A computer executes machine language programs mechanically -- that is without understanding them or thinking about them -- simply because of the way it is physically put together. This is not an easy concept. A computer is a machine built of millions of tiny switches called **transistors**, which have the property that they can be wired together in such a way that an output from one switch can turn another switch on or off. As a computer computes, these switches turn each other on or off in a pattern determined both by the way they are wired together and by the program that the computer is executing.

计算机机械地执行机器语言程序——即不会去理解或思考它们，采用这种方式与计算机的物理组成方式有关。要理解这个概念可能有些困难，我们需要知道：一台计算机由数百万个叫**晶体管**（Transistor）的微小开关（Switch）构成，这些开关用某种特定的方式集成在一起，并使其具有如下属性：一个开关开闭产生的输出信号能够改变另一个开关的开闭状态。当计算机进行计算时，这些开关按照连接方式及正在执行的程序共同决定的模式，互相控制闭合与断开。

Machine language instructions are expressed as binary numbers. A binary number is made up of just two possible digits, zero and one. Each zero or one is called a **bit**. So, a machine language instruction is just a sequence of zeros and ones. Each particular sequence encodes some particular instruction. The data that the computer manipulates is also encoded as binary numbers. In modern computers, each memory location holds a **byte**, which is a sequence of eight bits. (A machine language instruction or a piece of data generally consists of several bytes, stored in consecutive memory locations.)

机器语言指令以二进制数的方式表示。一个二进制数仅能为0或1。每个0或1称为1**位**（Bit）。所以，一条机器语言的指令就是一个由一些0和1构成的序列。每个特定的序列编码了一些特定的指令。计算机操作的数据也是一些二进制数编码而成。在现代计算机中，主存中的每一个存储单元储存1**字节**（Byte）空间的信息，每字节代表一个8位的序列。（一条机器语言指令或者一段数据通常占用多个字节空间，并且保存在连续的主存存储单元中。)

A computer can work directly with binary numbers because switches can readily represent such numbers: Turn the switch on to represent a one; turn it off to represent a zero. Machine language instructions are stored in memory as patterns of switches turned on or off. When a machine language instruction is loaded into the CPU, all that happens is that certain switches are turned on or off in the pattern that encodes that instruction. The CPU is built to respond to this pattern by executing the instruction it encodes; it does this simply because of the way all the other switches in the CPU are wired together.

计算机可以通过二进制数直接工作，是因为开关能够轻易地表达二进制数值——闭合开关即表示1、断开开关即表示0。机器语言指令以控制某些开关闭合或断开的模式存储于主存之中。当一条机器语言指令被读入CPU中，将会发生的便是指定的那些开关按照指令所编码的模式闭合或断开。CPU可以轻松地响应这种由指令编码的模式，因为构成它的开关都是连接在一起的。

So, you should understand this much about how computers work: Main memory holds machine language programs and data. These are encoded as binary numbers. The CPU fetches machine language instructions from memory one after another and executes them. It does this mechanically, without thinking about or understanding what it does -- and therefore the program it executes must be perfect, complete in all details, and unambiguous because the CPU can do nothing but execute it exactly as written. Here is a schematic view of this first-stage understanding of the computer:

所以，对于计算机是如何工作的问题，你应该有了以下的认识：主存存储着编码成二进制数的机器语言程序和数据。CPU机械地从主存中一条一条地读取并执行机器语言指令，而不去思考或者理解它们做了什么。CPU所执行的程序必须是功能完备且无歧义的，因为除了按照程序的内容去执行它以外，CPU什么都不管。以下是一张能初步了解计算机的原理图：
