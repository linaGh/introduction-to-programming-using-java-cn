MACHINE LANGUAGE CONSISTS of very simple instructions that can be executed directly by the CPU of a computer. Almost all programs, though, are written in high-level programming languages such as Java, Fortran, or C++. A program written in a **high-level language** cannot be run directly on any computer. First, it has to be translated into machine language. This translation can be done by a program called a **compiler**. A compiler takes a high-level-language program and translates it into an executable machine-language program. Once the translation is done, the machine-language program can be run any number of times, but of course it can only be run on one type of computer (since each type of computer has its own individual machine language). If the program is to run on another type of computer it has to be re-translated, using a different compiler, into the appropriate machine language.

机器语言由非常简单的指令组成，计算机的CPU可以直接执行这些指令。几乎所有的程序都是用Java、Fortran或C++这样的**高级语言**编写的。由高级语言编写的程序不能被任何计算机直接执行。首先，必须将其翻译成机器语言。这种翻译由一种称为**编译器**的程序完成，编译器将高级语言翻译成可执行的机器语言程序。当翻译完成后，机器语言的程序就可以运行任意多次。当然，只能在同一种类型的计算机上运行（这是因为每种类型的计算机都有自己独立的计算机语言）。如果该程序需要在另一种类型的计算机上运行，就必须使用另一种编译器重新翻译成对应的机器语言。

There is an alternative to compiling a high-level language program. Instead of using a compiler, which translates the program all at once, you can use an **interpreter**, which translates it instruction-by-instruction, as necessary. An interpreter is a program that acts much like a CPU, with a kind of fetch-and-execute cycle. In order to execute a program, the interpreter runs in a loop in which it repeatedly reads one instruction from the program, decides what is necessary to carry out that instruction, and then performs the appropriate machine-language commands to do so.

还有另一种编译高级语言的程序的方式。除了使用编译器一次性编译程序外，还可以使用**解释器**，按需求逐指令翻译程序。解释器也是一个程序，其扮演的角色和CPU类似，还有一个获取并执行（fetch-and-execute）循环。为了执行程序，解释器在一个循环中运行，重复从程序中读取每条指令，根据这条指令来决定要做些什么，然后执行对应的机器语言指令。

One use of interpreters is to execute high-level language programs. For example, the programming language Lisp is usually executed by an interpreter rather than a compiler. However, interpreters have another purpose: they can let you use a machine-language program meant for one type of computer on a completely different type of computer. For example, one of the original home computers was the Commodore 64 or "C64". While you might not find an actual C64, you can find programs that run on other computers -- or even in a web browser -- that "emulate" one. Such an emulator can run C64 programs by acting as an interpreter for the C64 machine language.

使用解释器的过程就是在执行高级语言的程序。例如，Lisp语言通常使用解释器执行，而不是编译器。然而，解释器还有其他目的：即可以在不同类型的计算机上使用同一种机器语言程序。例如，原来有一种家用计算机称为Commodore 64或“C64”。但在实际中并没有发现C64，不过发现了在其他计算机甚至浏览器中运行的程序可以模拟一个C64。这样的模拟器可以通过扮演C64机器语言的解释器来运行C64程序。

The designers of Java chose to use a combination of compilation and interpreting. Programs written in Java are compiled into machine language, but it is a machine language for a computer that doesn't really exist. This so-called "virtual" computer is known as the **Java Virtual Machine**, or JVM. The machine language for the Java Virtual Machine is called **Java bytecode**. There is no reason why Java bytecode couldn't be used as the machine language of a real computer, rather than a virtual computer. But in fact the use of a virtual machine makes possible one of the main selling points of Java: the fact that it can actually be used on **any** computer. All that the computer needs is an interpreter for Java bytecode. Such an interpreter simulates the JVM in the same way that a C64 emulator simulates a Commodore 64 computer. (The term JVM is also used for the Java bytecode interpreter program that does the simulation, so we say that a computer needs a JVM in order to run Java programs. Technically, it would be more correct to say that the interpreter *implements* the JVM than to say that it is a JVM.)

Java的设计者将编译和解释结合起来。Java编写的程序编译成机器语言，但并不存在使用这种机器语言的就是就是。这种“虚拟”的就是就是成为**Java虚拟机**（JVM）。JVM的机器语言成为**Java字节码**。Java字节码不仅可以用于虚拟的计算机，也可以用于真实的计算机。但实际上，使用虚拟机成就了Java的一个卖点：即Java字节码可以在**任何**计算机上使用。所有这些计算机只需要一个Java字节码的解释器。这种解释器模拟模拟JVM，就像C64模拟器模拟Commodore 64计算机那样。（属于JVM还可用于表示Java字节码解释器程序完成模拟的过程。所以我们说，若想运行Java程序，必须要有JVM。从技术上来讲，说解释器*实现了*JVM比解释器就是JVM要更加正确一些。）

Of course, a different Java bytecode interpreter is needed for each type of computer, but once a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter. This is one of the essential features of Java: the same compiled program can be run on many different types of computers.

当然，不同类型的计算机需要不同的Java字节码解释器，但每当一种计算机有了Java字节码解释器后，就可以运行任何Java字节码程序，这样的程序也可以运行在任何装有Java解释器的计算机上。这正是Java的本质属性：相同编译后的程序可以运行在许多不同的计算机上。

Why, you might wonder, use the intermediate Java bytecode at all? Why not just distribute the original Java program and let each person compile it into the machine language of whatever computer they want to run it on? There are several reasons. First of all, a compiler has to understand Java, a complex high-level language. The compiler is itself a complex program. A Java bytecode interpreter, on the other hand, is a relatively small, simple program. This makes it easy to write a bytecode interpreter for a new type of computer; once that is done, that computer can run any compiled Java program. It would be much harder to write a Java compiler for the same computer.

但为什么能在所有地方都使用中间的Java字节码？为什么不直接分发原来的Java程序，让每个人自行将其编译成需要运行的计算机上的机器语言。其中的原因有很多。首先，需要有一个理解Java这门高级语言的编译器。这种编译器本身就是一个复杂的程序。另一方面，Java字节码解释器，是一个相对来说较小，简单的程序。因此，很容易为一种新类型的计算机编写一个字节码解释器。完成这一步后，新计算机就可以运行任何编译过的Java程序。而为同样的计算机编写一个Java编译器却困难的多。

Furthermore, some Java programs are meant to be downloaded over a network. This leads to obvious security concerns: you don't want to download and run a program that will damage your computer or your files. The bytecode interpreter acts as a buffer between you and the program you download. You are really running the interpreter, which runs the downloaded program indirectly. The interpreter can protect you from potentially dangerous actions on the part of that program.

除此之外，有些Java程序需要从网络下载。 这会导致显而易见的安全问题：我们不想运行会损害计算机或文件的程序。字节码解释器在计算机和下载的程序之间充当一个缓存。在实际中，运行的是解释器，这样是间接的运行下载下来的程序。解释器可以阻止下载下来的程序中含有的潜在的危险行为。

When Java was still a new language, it was criticized for being slow: Since Java bytecode was executed by an interpreter, it seemed that Java bytecode programs could never run as quickly as programs compiled into native machine language (that is, the actual machine language of the computer on which the program is running). However, this problem has been largely overcome by the use of just-in-time compilers for executing Java bytecode. A **just-in-time compiler** translates Java bytecode into native machine language. It does this while it is executing the program. Just as for a normal interpreter, the input to a just-in-time compiler is a Java bytecode program, and its task is to execute that program. But as it is executing the program, it also translates parts of it into machine language. The translated parts of the program can then be executed much more quickly than they could be interpreted. Since a given part of a program is often executed many times as the program runs, a just-in-time compiler can significantly speed up the overall execution time.

在Java刚问世不久时，人们经常批评Java很慢。这是因为Java字节码由解释器运行，看上去Java字节码永远不会像编译成机器语言的语言那样快（后者实际上是在运行计算机自身的机器语言）。但是，通过即时（JIT）编译器执行Java字节码可以在很大程度上克服这一缺点。**即时编译器**将Java字节码翻译成本地机器语言。其在执行程序时完成这一步骤。对于普通的解释器，输入到即时编译器的是Java字节码，其任务是执行这个程序。但在执行时，还会将其中的某些部分翻译成机器语言。翻译的部分执行起来比解释执行要快得多。由于在程序运行时，某些部分可能会多次执行，所以即时编译器可以有效的减少总体执行时间。

I should note that there is no necessary connection between Java and Java bytecode. A program written in Java could certainly be compiled into the machine language of a real computer. And programs written in other languages can be compiled into Java bytecode. However, the combination of Java and Java bytecode is platform-independent, secure, and network-compatible while allowing you to program in a modern high-level object-oriented language.

这里需要提醒一下，Java和Java字节码之间没有必然的联系。Java编写的程序依然可以编译成真实计算机的机器语言。其他语言编写的程序可以编译成Java字节码。但Java和Java字节码之间的组合是不依赖特定平台、安全、网络兼容的，这样允许用户以现代的高级面向对象的语言编写程序。

(In the past few years, it has become fairly common to create new programming languages, or versions of old languages, that compile into Java bytecode. The compiled bytecode programs can then be executed by a standard JVM. New languages that have been developed specifically for programming the JVM include Groovy, Clojure, and Processing. Jython and JRuby are versions of older languages, Python and Ruby, that target the JVM. These languages make it possible to enjoy many of the advantages of the JVM while avoiding some of the technicalities of the Java language. In fact, the use of other languages with the JVM has become important enough that several new features have been added to the JVM specifically to add better support for some of those languages. And this improvement to the JVM has in turn made possible some of the new features in Java 7 and Java 8.)

在过去几年，有许多新语言或已存在的语言都编译成Java字节码。编译后的字节码程序可以用标准的JVM运行。专门为JVM开发的新语言包括Groovy、Clojure、Processing。面向JVM的Jython和JRuby分别表示的已有的Python和Ruby。这些语言可以在不使用Java的情况下享受JVM的优势。实际上，以其他语言使用JVM变得越来越重要，一致JVM中添加了一些新特性，其目的就是为了更好的支持这些语言。JVM的这些改进已经成为了Java 7和Java 8中的一些新特性。

I should also note that the really hard part of platform-independence is providing a "Graphical User Interface" -- with windows, buttons, etc. -- that will work on all the platforms that support Java. You'll see more about this problem in [Section 1.6][1].

这里还要提醒一点，在不依赖特定平台方面，提供“图形用户界面GUI”这个特性是非常困难的（GUI是指窗体、按钮等这类的东西）。不过Java也能全平台的支持。详见[1.6节][1]。
