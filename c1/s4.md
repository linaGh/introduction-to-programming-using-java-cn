THERE ARE TWO BASIC ASPECTS of programming: data and instructions. To work with data, you need to understand variables and types; to work with instructions, you need to understand **control structures** and **subroutines**. You'll spend a large part of the course becoming familiar with these concepts.

编程有两个基本的方面：数据和指令。要了解数据，就要先了解变量和类型的概念，要了解指令，就要先了解**控制结构**和**子程序**。本课将会花很大的篇幅让你熟悉这些概念。

A **variable** is just a memory location (or several consecutive locations treated as a unit) that has been given a name so that it can be easily referred to and used in a program. The programmer only has to worry about the name; it is the compiler's responsibility to keep track of the memory location. As a programmer, you need to keep in mind that the name refers to a kind of "box" in memory that can hold data, even though you don't have to know where in memory that box is located.

**变量**是指一个存储单元（或被当做一个整体的若干个连贯的存储单元），每个变量都被赋予一个名字，这样就可以很容易的在程序中引用，程序员只需要关心变量的名字；追踪存储单元的职责由编译器来承担。作为一个程序员，你需要知道的是这些变量名指向的是内存中的一种“盒子”，盒子里面存放着数据，你不需要知道这个盒子在内存中的位置。

In Java and in many other programming languages, a variable has a **type** that indicates what sort of data it can hold. One type of variable might hold integers -- whole numbers such as 3, -7, and 0 -- while another holds floating point numbers -- numbers with decimal points such as 3.14, -2.7, or 17.0. (Yes, the computer does make a distinction between the integer 17 and the floating-point number 17.0; they actually look quite different inside the computer.) There could also be types for individual characters ('A', ';', etc.), strings ("Hello", "A string can include many characters", etc.), and less common types such as dates, colors, sounds, or any other kind of data that a program might need to store.

在Java和其它许多编程语言中，变量的**类型**表明它可以存储什么样的数据。一种变量可能用来存储整数（Integer）——例如3，-7和0这样的整数——另一种变量可能用来存储浮点数（Float）——例如3.14，-2.7或17.0这样的带小数点的数字。（是的，计算机对整数17和浮点数17.0确实有所区别；它们在计算机内部的差别其实很大。）此外还有字符类型（Characters）（“A”，“；”等等），字符串（String）（“Hello”, “A string can include many characters”等），还有一些不常用的类型例如日期，颜色，声音，或程序需要存储的其它数据类型。

Programming languages always have commands for getting data into and out of variables and for doing computations with data. For example, the following "assignment statement," which might appear in a Java program, tells the computer to take the number stored in the variable named "principal", multiply that number by 0.07, and then store the result in the variable named "interest":

编程语言总是有把数据存入变量或者读取数据的指令，还有使用数据做计算的指令。例如，下面这个可能会出现在Java程序中的“赋值语句”，告诉计算机读取存储在变量名叫“principal”（本金）中的数据，乘以0.07后把结果存储在名叫“interest”（利息）的变量名中。

```java
interest = principal * 0.07;
```

There are also "input commands" for getting data from the user or from files on the computer's disks, and there are "output commands" for sending data in the other direction.

还有一些“输入命令”用来用户输入的或者从存储在计算机磁盘的文件中读取来的数据，同时也有“输出命令”反方向输出数据。

These basic commands -- for moving data from place to place and for performing computations -- are the building blocks for all programs. These building blocks are combined into complex programs using control structures and subroutines.

这些基本的指令——把数据从一个地方挪到另一个地方以及执行计算的指令——是所有程序的构建模块。这些构建模块通过使用控制结构和子程序组合形成复杂的程序。

A program is a sequence of instructions. In the ordinary "flow of control," the computer executes the instructions in the sequence in which they occur in the program, one after the other. However, this is obviously very limited: the computer would soon run out of instructions to execute. **Control structures** are special instructions that can change the flow of control. There are two basic types of control structure: **loops**, which allow a sequence of instructions to be repeated over and over, and **branches**, which allow the computer to decide between two or more different courses of action by testing conditions that occur as the program is running.

一个程序是一系列的指令。在普通的“控制流”中，计算机按照指令在程序中出现的顺序一个接着一个依次执行指令。但是，这显然是有局限性的：计算机很快就会无指令可执行。**控制结构**是可以改变控制流的特别的指令。控制结构有两个基本类型：**循环**（Loops），使得一系列指令一遍遍的重复；**分支**（Branches），使得计算机可以在程序运行时根据条件从两到多组指令中选择执行。

For example, it might be that if the value of the variable "principal" is greater than 10000, then the "interest" should be computed by multiplying the principal by 0.05; if not, then the interest should be computed by multiplying the principal by 0.04. A program needs some way of expressing this type of decision. In Java, it could be expressed using the following "if statement":

例如，如果变量“principal”的值大于10000，那么“interest”的值就是principal乘以0.05的结果；如果不大于10000，那么interest就是principal乘以0.04的结果。一个程序需要一些这类判断类型的实现。在Java中，就会使用下面的“if语句”：

```java
if (principal > 10000)
    interest = principal * 0.05;
else
    interest = principal * 0.04;
```

(Don't worry about the details for now. Just remember that the computer can test a condition and decide what to do next on the basis of that test.)

（现在先别担心细节。先记住计算机可以进行条件判断，并在此基础上决定下一步的走向。）

Loops are used when the same task has to be performed more than once. For example, if you want to print out a mailing label for each name on a mailing list, you might say, "Get the first name and address and print the label; get the second name and address and print the label; get the third name and address and print the label..." But this quickly becomes ridiculous -- and might not work at all if you don't know in advance how many names there are. What you would like to say is something like "While there are more names to process, get the next name and address, and print the label." A loop can be used in a program to express such repetition.

循环被用于重复执行同一个任务多次。例如，如果你想要为邮寄名单上的每一个名字打印邮寄地址，你可能会说：“获得第一个名字和地址并打印出来；获得第二个名字和地址并打印出来；获得第三个名字和地址并打印出来……”但是这很快就会变得不可理喻——如果你不知道到底有多少个名字的话这就根本不现实。所以你其实想说的应该是“只要名单上还有未打印的名字，就获取下一个名字和地址，打印出来。”循环就被用于表达这种重复。

Large programs are so complex that it would be almost impossible to write them if there were not some way to break them up into manageable "chunks." Subroutines provide one way to do this. A **subroutine** consists of the instructions for performing some task, grouped together as a unit and given a name. That name can then be used as a substitute for the whole set of instructions. For example, suppose that one of the tasks that your program needs to perform is to draw a house on the screen. You can take the necessary instructions, make them into a subroutine, and give that subroutine some appropriate name -- say, "drawHouse()". Then anyplace in your program where you need to draw a house, you can do so with the single command:

大型程序非常复杂，几乎难以编写，除非使用“模块”的方式把它们进行分块管理。子程序可以实现这一功能。一个**子程序**包括一些执行任务的指令，把它们组合成一个单元并赋予一个名字。这个名字可以用来指代整个指令集。例如，你的程序的任务之一是在屏幕上画一个房子，你可以使用必须的指令拼成一个子程序，并为这个子程序命名为“drawHouse()”，那么你的程序中任何需要画房子的地方，你都可以使用一句简单的指令：

```java
drawHouse();
```

This will have the same effect as repeating all the house-drawing instructions in each place.

这将会在每一个使用这句话的地方重复运行整个画房子指令，得出同样的效果。

The advantage here is not just that you save typing. Organizing your program into subroutines also helps you organize your thinking and your program design effort. While writing the house-drawing subroutine, you can concentrate on the problem of drawing a house without worrying for the moment about the rest of the program. And once the subroutine is written, you can forget about the details of drawing houses -- that problem is solved, since you have a subroutine to do it for you. A subroutine becomes just like a built-in part of the language which you can use without thinking about the details of what goes on "inside" the subroutine.

这里的优势不仅仅是少打了几行字。使用子程序组织你的程序同样帮助你组织你的思考过程和你的程序设计。当你在编写画房子程序时，你可以集中思考画房子功能，而不用担心程序的其他部分。并且这个子程序一旦写完，你就可以忘记画房子的细节——问题已经解决了，你已经有了一个画房子的子程序了。子程序自此成为了编程语言的内置部分，你可以直接使用而不再需要思考子程序的具体实现细节。

Variables, types, loops, branches, and subroutines are the basis of what might be called "traditional programming." However, as programs become larger, additional structure is needed to help deal with their complexity. One of the most effective tools that has been found is object-oriented programming, which is discussed in the next section.
