THE CPU SPENDS ALMOST ALL of its time fetching instructions from memory and executing them. However, the CPU and main memory are only two out of many components in a real computer system. A complete system contains other devices such as:

* A **hard disk** or **solid state drive** for storing programs and data files. (Note that main memory holds only a comparatively small amount of information, and holds it only as long as the power is turned on. A hard disk or solid state drive is used for permanent storage of larger amounts of information, but programs have to be loaded from there into main memory before they can actually be executed. A hard disk stores data on a spinning magnetic disk, while a solid state drive is a purely electronic device with no moving parts.)
* A **keyboard** and **mouse** for user input.
* A **monitor** and **printer** which can be used to display the computer's output.
* An **audio output device** that allows the computer to play sounds.
* A **network interface** that allows the computer to communicate with other computers that are connected to it on a network, either wirelessly or by wire.
* A **scanner** that converts images into coded binary numbers that can be stored and manipulated on the computer.

CPU几乎把所有的时间都花费在从内存获取指令并运行它们的过程中。然而，CPU和主存仅仅只是计算机硬件系统中众多组件的其中两个。一个完整的系统还包含其他的设备，比如：

* **硬盘**或者**固态硬盘**，用来存储程序和数据文件的。（注意，主存仅保存少量的信息，并且只有在计算机接通电源的时候才能保存信息。硬盘或者固态硬盘用来永久存储大量的信息。但是在程序真正运行前，程序必须把硬盘或者固态硬盘里的数据加载到主存中。硬盘把数据存储在旋转磁盘中（spinning magnetic disk），而固态硬盘把数据存储在纯粹的电子设备里，它不需要旋转或者任何的机械运动。
* **键盘**和**鼠标**，给用户进行输入。
* **显示器**和**打印机**，用来显示计算机的输出。
* **音频输出设备**，使计算能够播放声音。
* **网络接口**，使计算机能够与其他联网的计算机进行通信，这些联网的计算机通过有线或者无线的方式进行联网。
* **扫描仪**，把图片转化为能够在计算机上存储和操作的二进制代码。

The list of devices is entirely open ended, and computer systems are built so that they can easily be expanded by adding new devices. Somehow the CPU has to communicate with and control all these devices. The CPU can only do this by executing machine language instructions (which is all it can do, period). The way this works is that for each device in a system, there is a **device driver**, which consists of software that the CPU executes when it has to deal with the device. Installing a new device on a system generally has two steps: plugging the device physically into the computer, and installing the device driver software. Without the device driver, the actual physical device would be useless, since the CPU would not be able to communicate with it.

上面列出的设备全都是开放式的（open ended）,并且计算机被设计成能够通过添加新的设备来简易地扩展计算机。CPU必须以某种方式和这些设备通信并控制它们，并且它只能通过运行机器语言指令来实现这个过程（这是它所能做到的一切了）。这个过程的实现方式是在系统中的每个设备都对应一个**设备驱动**，这些驱动都是一些应用软件并在CPU与设备交互时运行。在系统中安装新的设备通常需要两个步骤：把物理设备查到计算机里，然后安装设备驱动软件。如果没有设备驱动，由于CPU不能与物理设备进行通信，物理设备将会变得毫无用处。

A computer system consisting of many devices is typically organized by connecting those devices to one or more **busses**. A bus is a set of wires that carry various sorts of information between the devices connected to those wires. The wires carry data, addresses, and control signals. An address directs the data to a particular device and perhaps to a particular register or location within that device. Control signals can be used, for example, by one device to alert another that data is available for it on the data bus. A fairly simple computer system might be organized like this:

由众多设备组成的计算机系统通常是把这些设备连接到一条或者多条**总线**上进行组织的。一条总线就是一组导线，这些导线携带着连接到这些导线上的设备的各种信息。导线携带的信息包括数据、地址和控制信号。地址信息指引数据到特定的设备或者特定的寄存器或者特定设备内的特定位置。控制信号可以用于一个设备通知另外一个设备可以在数据总线上获取该数据。一个非常简单的计算机系统可以这样组织：

Now, devices such as keyboard, mouse, and network interface can produce input that needs to be processed by the CPU. How does the CPU know that the data is there? One simple idea, which turns out to be not very satisfactory, is for the CPU to keep checking for incoming data over and over. Whenever it finds data, it processes it. This method is called **polling**, since the CPU polls the input devices continually to see whether they have any input data to report. Unfortunately, although polling is very simple, it is also very inefficient. The CPU can waste an awful lot of time just waiting for input.

如今，键盘、鼠标和网络接口等设备都可以产生输入数据并需要CPU处理这些数据。那么CPU是怎样知道数据已经到来了呢？一个简单并不太理想的方法就是让CPU不停地检查数据是否已经到来，并在每次发现数据时就处理这些数据。因为CPU需要持续地轮询输入设备来检测是否有输入数据需要处理，所以这个方法叫做**轮询**。不幸的是，尽管轮询很简单，但它的效率同样也很低。因为CPU把大量的时间都只花费在等待输入上。

To avoid this inefficiency, **interrupts** are generally used instead of polling. An interrupt is a signal sent by another device to the CPU. The CPU responds to an interrupt signal by putting aside whatever it is doing in order to respond to the interrupt. Once it has handled the interrupt, it returns to what it was doing before the interrupt occurred. For example, when you press a key on your computer keyboard, a keyboard interrupt is sent to the CPU. The CPU responds to this signal by interrupting what it is doing, reading the key that you pressed, processing it, and then returning to the task it was performing before you pressed the key.

为了提高效率，通常使用**中断**来代替轮询。中断是其他设备发送给CPU的信号。CPU为了响应中断信号，它会搁置正在处理的事务去响应中断信号。一旦CPU处理完中断，它就会返回并处理中断出现时搁置的事务。例如，当你按下键盘的一个键位时，键盘中断就会被发到CPU那。然后CPU就通过中断正在处理的事务来响应这个中断信号，并读取和处理你按下的键位信息。最后，CPU会返回到你按下键位前正在执行的任务。

Again, you should understand that this is a purely mechanical process: A device signals an interrupt simply by turning on a wire. The CPU is built so that when that wire is turned on, the CPU saves enough information about what it is currently doing so that it can return to the same state later. This information consists of the contents of important internal registers such as the program counter. Then the CPU jumps to some predetermined memory location and begins executing the instructions stored there. Those instructions make up an **interrupt handler** that does the processing necessary to respond to the interrupt. (This interrupt handler is part of the device driver software for the device that signaled the interrupt.) At the end of the interrupt handler is an instruction that tells the CPU to jump back to what it was doing; it does that by restoring its previously saved state.

此外你需要知道的是，这个中断机制完全是使用硬件实现的：设备单纯地通过接通导线来表示中断信息。CPU被设计成当接通导线时，它就会把正在处理的事务信息保存下来（保存现场信息）用以之后能够返回同一状态（恢复现场）。这些信息包含程序计数器等重要内部寄存器内容。然后CPU会跳到一些预设的内存位置并执行存储在那的指令。这些指令构成了一个**中断处理器**用来进行一些必要的处理去响应中断（这个中断处理器是发送信号的设备的驱动软件的一部分）。中断处理器的最后一条指令利用之前保存的状态信息来指示CPU跳回现场。

Interrupts allow the CPU to deal with **asynchronous events**. In the regular fetch-and-execute cycle, things happen in a predetermined order; everything that happens is "synchronized" with everything else. Interrupts make it possible for the CPU to deal efficiently with events that happen "asynchronously," that is, at unpredictable times.

中断使CPU能够处理**异步事件**。在定期的读取-执行循环中，事件都是在预定的顺序发生的；所有的事件都是和其他事件“同步”发生的。中断让CPU使用“异步”高效地处理事件成为可能，这时事件发生的时间是不可预测的。

As another example of how interrupts are used, consider what happens when the CPU needs to access data that is stored on a hard disk. The CPU can access data directly only if it is in main memory. Data on the disk has to be copied into memory before it can be accessed. Unfortunately, on the scale of speed at which the CPU operates, the disk drive is extremely slow. When the CPU needs data from the disk, it sends a signal to the disk drive telling it to locate the data and get it ready. (This signal is sent synchronously, under the control of a regular program.) Then, instead of just waiting the long and unpredictable amount of time that the disk drive will take to do this, the CPU goes on with some other task. When the disk drive has the data ready, it sends an interrupt signal to the CPU. The interrupt handler can then read the requested data.

作为使用中断的另一个例子，思考一下当CPU需要访问存储在硬盘上的数据时会发生什么事情？CPU只能直接访问内存里的数据。所以在访问硬盘上的数据前必须把数据复制到内存里。不幸的是，相比于CPU的运行速度，硬盘的速度显得很慢。当CPU需要硬盘上的数据时，它会给硬盘驱动发出信号要求它去定位并准备数据（这个信号是在常规的程序下异步发送的）。然后CPU继续去做一些其他的任务而不是进行不可预测的长时间等待，这个等待过程将由硬盘驱动去完成。当硬盘驱动准备好数据后，它会发送一个中断信号给CPU。之后中断处理器会读取请求数据。

Now, you might have noticed that all this only makes sense if the CPU actually has several tasks to perform. If it has nothing better to do, it might as well spend its time polling for input or waiting for disk drive operations to complete. All modern computers use **multitasking** to perform several tasks at once. Some computers can be used by several people at once. Since the CPU is so fast, it can quickly switch its attention from one user to another, devoting a fraction of a second to each user in turn. This application of multitasking is called **timesharing**. But a modern personal computer with just a single user also uses multitasking. For example, the user might be typing a paper while a clock is continuously displaying the time and a file is being downloaded over the network.

现在你可能已经注意到只有在CPU有多个任务要执行时才能体现出中断的作用。如果CPU只有一个任务要执行，中断同样会把时间花费在轮询输入上或者等待硬盘驱动操作的完成。所有的现代计算机都使用**多任务处理**（multitasking）来一次执行多个任务。有些计算机能够在同一时间给多个用户同时使用。因为CPU的速度是很快的，所有它能够快速地从一个用户切换到另一个用户上工作，并依次为每个用户工作很短的时间。这种多任务处理的运用叫做**分时系统**（timesharing）。尽管如此，只有一个用户的现代个人计算机同样使用了多任务处理。例如，在时钟程序持续地显示时间和在网上下载文件的同时，用户可能也在使用计算机写论文。

Each of the individual tasks that the CPU is working on is called a **thread**. (Or a **process**; there are technical differences between threads and processes, but they are not important here, since it is threads that are used in Java.) Many CPUs can literally execute more than one thread simultaneously -- such CPUs contain multiple "cores," each of which can run a thread -- but there is always a limit on the number of threads that can be executed at the same time. Since there are often more threads than can be executed simultaneously, the computer has to be able switch its attention from one thread to another, just as a timesharing computer switches its attention from one user to another. In general, a thread that is being executed will continue to run until one of several things happens:

CPU在执行的每一个单一的任务叫作一条**线程**（或者一个**进程**；线程和进程之间是有技术差异的，不过这个差异在这不重要，因为我们要讨论的线程是Java中的线程）。很多CPU可以同时运行多个线程——这些CPU包含多个“核”并且每个核都能运行一条线程，然而同时运行的线程数量是有限的。时常因为线程太多了而不能同时运行所有的线程，计算机必须能够从一条线程切换到另一条线程上工作，就像分时计算机从一个用户切换到两一个用户一样。通常，一条正在运行的线程会一直运行下去，除非出现这些情况的其中一个：

* The thread might voluntarily **yield** control, to give other threads a chance to run.
* The thread might have to wait for some asynchronous event to occur. For example, the thread might request some data from the disk drive, or it might wait for the user to press a key. While it is waiting, the thread is said to be **blocked**, and other threads, if any, have a chance to run. When the event occurs, an interrupt will "wake up" the thread so that it can continue running.
* The thread might use up its allotted slice of time and be suspended to allow other threads to run. Not all computers can "forcibly" suspend a thread in this way; those that can are said to use preemptive multitasking. To do **preemptive multitasking**, a computer needs a special timer device that generates an interrupt at regular intervals, such as 100 times per second. When a timer interrupt occurs, the CPU has a chance to switch from one thread to another, whether the thread that is currently running likes it or not. All modern desktop and laptop computers, and even typical smartphones and tablets, use preemptive multitasking.

* 线程**自愿让出**（yield）控制权，给其他线程运行的机会。
* 线程可能必须要等待一些异步事件的发生。例如，线程可能需要硬盘上的一些数据，或者它可能在等待用户按下键位。当线程在等待时，我们称它被**阻塞了**（blocked）。此时，如果还有其他线程的话，它们就拥有了运行的机会。当等待的事件出现时，中断将会“唤醒”阻塞线程继续运行。
* 线程可能因为耗尽分配给它的时间片而被挂起来使其他的线程能够运行。不是所有的计算机都能够以这种方式”强制”挂起线程的。那些能够“强制”挂起的叫作**抢占式多任务系统**（preemptive multitasking）。要使用抢占式多任务，计算机需要一个能够定期产生中断的特殊定时设备，比如每秒产生100次。当定时中断产生时，CPU就可以从一条线程切换到另一条线程，而不管线程是否正在执行。所有的现代台式机和笔记本，甚至是平常的智能手机和平板，都在使用抢占式多任务。

Ordinary users, and indeed ordinary programmers, have no need to deal with interrupts and interrupt handlers. They can concentrate on the different tasks or threads that they want the computer to perform; the details of how the computer manages to get all those tasks done are not important to them. In fact, most users, and many programmers, can ignore threads and multitasking altogether. However, threads have become increasingly important as computers have become more powerful and as they have begun to make more use of multitasking and multiprocessing. In fact, the ability to work with threads is fast becoming an essential job skill for programmers. Fortunately, Java has good support for threads, which are built into the Java programming language as a fundamental programming concept. Programming with threads will be covered in [Chapter 12][1].

普通用户，甚至普通程序员，不需要与中断和中断处理器打交道。他们可以集中精力在不同的任务处理或者他们要计算机执行的线程上。计算机是如何完成这些任务的细节对他们来说不重要。实际上，大多数用户和很多的程序员都可以忽视线程和多任务。然而，随着计算机变得越来越强大、多任务和多进程的使用越来越多，线程已经变得越来越重要了。实际上，使用线程的能力很快就会变成程序员的一项基本能力了。幸运的是，Java对线程提供了很好的支持，它把线程当做一个基本的程序概念内置到Java编程语言里。在[第12章][1]里将会讲到使用线程编程的内容。

Just as important in Java and in modern programming in general is the basic concept of asynchronous events. While programmers don't actually deal with interrupts directly, they do often find themselves writing **event handlers**, which, like interrupt handlers, are called asynchronously when specific events occur. Such "event-driven programming" has a very different feel from the more traditional straight-through, synchronous programming. We will begin with the more traditional type of programming, which is still used for programming individual tasks, but we will return to threads and events later in the text, starting in Chapter 6

通常，在Java和现代编程里同样重要的是异步事件的基本概念。即使程序员实际上并不直接与中断打交道，他们常常也会发现他们在编写**事件处理器**。事件处理器与中断处理器类似，当特定的事件发生时它就会被调用。与很多传统的、直通式的、同步的编程相比，“事件驱动编程”拥有不一样的体验。我们将会从传统类型的编程开始讲起，它们现在依然被用来编写单一任务的程序。不过我们将会在[第6章][2]里再来讲解线程和事件。

By the way, the software that does all the interrupt handling, handles communication with the user and with hardware devices, and controls which thread is allowed to run is called the operating system. The operating system is the basic, essential software without which a computer would not be able to function. Other programs, such as word processors and Web browsers, are dependent upon the operating system. Common **operating systems** include Linux, various versions of Windows, and Mac OS.

顺便提一下，执行所有的中断处理、操纵用户与硬件设备之间的交互和控制哪条线程可以运行的软件叫作操作系统。操作系统是最基本、最重要的软件，没有它计算机就不能够正常地运作。文字处理器和Web浏览器等其他的程序都要依赖于**操作系统**。常见的操作系统包括Linux、各个版本的Windows和Mac OS。
